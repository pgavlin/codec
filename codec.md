- Serialzer/Deserializer:
	- analogs of serde::{Serialize,Deserialize}
	- Serialize accepts a Serializer
	- Deserialize accepts a Deserializer
- Encoder/Decoder:
	- analogs of serde::{Serializer,Deserializer}
	- Decoder uses a Visitor to drive deserialization
- Visitor:
	- analog of serde::de::Visitor

- Open questions:
    - how to allow formats to special-case based on destination type?
        - formats only see the visitor, not the actual destination
        - could add a Type() method or something on visitor s.t. the format can see the type
    - how to allow formats to special-case based on struct fields?
        - this seems clearer: first-class struct decoding/encoding
